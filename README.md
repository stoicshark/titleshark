Reads browser window titles and saves them into a text file for use with OBS. Works with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, make sure the windows you want tracked are in thier own seperate main window (Minimizing shouldn't affect tracking). Has very basic detection functionality to automatically track browser titles for YouTube and aersia.skie.me (VIP). It can also be manually set to track other windows for title changes.

Save file name and update intervals (in seconds) can be changed in the INI file. A timeout can be set (in seconds) for the program to quit searching for a window title if it's unable to find it. The timeout can be disabled by setting it to 0. Filters can also be added in the INI, they can remove unwanted words, symbols, etc. from every title retrieved.
